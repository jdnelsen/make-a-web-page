      <div class="notes-dscription">
      <p>
        Coding happens when programmers write text in a language that a computer can understand. The computer can then follow the instructions the programmer wrote.

      <p>
        An HTML element refers to everything within a set of opening and closing tags. Some elements are for inline content while others for block. Inline simply means that the content is viewed as being on the same line or lines, while block content has padding around it placing it in its own invisible content box. Every element has a box.

         <p> First looks for natural boxes. Look for repeated Styles and elements. Write the HTML. Apply the styles largest to smallest, then fix the small things. Do this until you are happy. Developer tools are a great way to do this. Use an HTML and CSS verifier.
